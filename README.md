# The 'People' Plugin #

This is a WordPress plugin that creates a custom post type for "people", where each post of this type is a "person". This is useful for overloading the built-in WordPress "user" construct, and for making creating entities that might map to real-world people, but that don't have any WordPress user account.

## Installation ##

1. Install from [the WordPress.org plugin repository](TBD).
2. Activate the 'People' plugin via your site's `wp-admin/`.

## Usage ##

* Invoke with the `[people]` shortcode.
* Customize output by adding a filter to `people_item_callback`

For more usage information, see the `readme.txt` file, or [the plugin's page on WordPress.org](TBD).
